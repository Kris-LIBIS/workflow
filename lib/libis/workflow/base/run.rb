      # Base module for all workflow runs. It is created by an associated workflow when the workflow is executed.
      #
      # This module lacks the implementation for the data attributes. It functions as an interface that describes the
      # common functionality regardless of the storage implementation. These attributes require some implementation:
      #
      # - start_date: [Time] the timestamp of the execution of the run
      # - job: [Object] a reference to the Job this Run belongs to
      #
      # Note that ::Libis::Workflow::Base::WorkItem is a parent module and therefore requires implementation of the
      # attributes of that module too.
      #
      # A simple in-memory implementation can be found in ::Libis::Workflow::Run
      module Run

        #    previously.
        #  - When using the :retry action a task will not perform on an item if it was successful the last time. This
        #    allows you to retry a run when an temporary error (e.g. asynchronous wait or halt) occured.
