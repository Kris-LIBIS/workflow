      # Base module for all work items.
      #
      # This module lacks the implementation for the data attributes. It functions as an interface that describes the
      # common functionality regardless of the storage implementation. These attributes require some implementation:
      #
      # - status: [Symbol] the status field. Each task sets the status of the items it works on. Before starting processing
      #     the status is set to "#{task_name}Started". After successfull processing it is set to "#{task_name}Done" and if
      #     the task failed, it is set to "#{task_name}Failed". The status field can be used to perform real-time
      #     monitoring, reporting and error-recovery or restart of the ingest.
      #     The initial value for this attribute is :START.
      # - parent: [Object|nil] a link to a parent work item. Work items can be organized in any hierarchy you think is
      #     relevant for your workflow (e.g. directory[/directory...]/file/line or library/section/book/page). Of course
      #     hierarchies are not mandatory.
      # - items: [Array] a list of child work items. see above.
      # - options: [Hash] a set of options for the task chain on how to deal with this work item. This attribute can be
      #     used to fine-tune the behaviour of tasks for a particular work item.
      # - properties: [Hash] a set of properties, typically collected during the workflow processing and used to store
      #     final or intermediate resulst of tasks. The ::Lias::Ingester::FileItem module uses this attribute to store the
      #     properties (e.g. size, checksum, ...) of the file it represents.
      # - log_history: [Array] a list of all logging messages collected for this work item. Whenever a task logs a message
      #     it will automatically be registered for the work item that it is processing or for the work item that was
      #     supplied as the first argument.
      # - status_log: [Array] a list of all status changes the work item went through.
      # - summary: [Hash] collected statistics about the ingest for the work item and its children. This structure will
      #     be filled in by the included task ::Lias::Ingester::Tasks::Analyzer wich is appended to the workflow by default.
      #
      # The module is created so that it is possible to implement an ActiveRecord/Datamapper/... implementation easily.
      # A simple in-memory implementation would require:
      #
      # attr_accessor :parent
      # attr_accessor :items
      # attr_accessor :options, :properties
      # attr_accessor :log_history, :status_log
      # attr_accessor :summary
      #
      # def initialize
      #   self.parent = nil
      #   self.items = []
      #   self.options = {}
      #   self.properties = {}
      #   self.log_history = []
      #   self.status_log = []
      #   self.summary = {}
      # end
      #
      # protected
      #
      # ## Methods below should be adapted to match the implementation of the log arrays
      #
      # def add_log_entry(msg)
      #   self.log_history << msg.merge(c_at: ::Time.now)
      # end
      #
      # def add_status_log(message, tasklist = nil)
      #   self.status_log << { c_at: ::Time.now, tasklist: tasklist, text: message }.cleanup
      # end
