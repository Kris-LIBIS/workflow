module LIBIS
  module Workflow

    # Base module for all work items.
    #
    # This module contains some basic attributes required for making the workflow and tasks behave properly:
    #
    # - status: [Symbol] the status field. Each task sets the status of the items it works on. Before starting processing
    #     the status is set to "#{task_name}Started". After successfull processing it is set to "#{task_name}Done" and if
    #     the task failed, it is set to "#{task_name}Failed". The status field can be used to perform real-time
    #     monitoring, reporting and error-recovery or restart of the ingest.
    #     The initial value for this attribute is :START.
    # - parent: [Object|nil] a link to a parent work item. Work items can be organized in any hierarchy you think is
    #     relevant for your workflow (e.g. directory[/directory...]/file/line or library/section/book/page). Of course
    #     hierarchies are not mandatory.
    # - items: [Array] a list of child work items. see above.
    # - options: [Hash] a set of options for the task chain on how to deal with this work item. This attribute can be
    #     used to fine-tune the behaviour of tasks for a particular work item.
    # - properties: [Hash] a set of properties, typically collected during the workflow processing and used to store
    #     final or intermediate resulst of tasks. The ::Lias::Ingester::FileItem module uses this attribute to store the
    #     properties (e.g. size, checksum, ...) of the file it represents.
    # - log_history: [Array] a list of all logging messages collected for this work item. Whenever a task logs a message
    #     it will automatically be registered for the work item that it is processing or for the work item that was
    #     supplied as the first argument.
    # - status_log: [Array] a list of all status changes the work item went through.
    # - summary: [Hash] collected statistics about the ingest for the work item and its children. This structure will
    #     be filled in by the included task ::Lias::Ingester::Tasks::Analyzer wich is appended to the workflow by default.
    #
    # The module is created so that it is possible to implement an ActiveRecord/Datamapper/... implementation easily.
